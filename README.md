## TinyBitSet

- tiny c++ library for fast operations on tiny sets of the integers between 1 and largest int size, (1-64)
- mappings in bitmapping.h for removing need to compute at runtime
- instantiating, or calling any of the operations o a TinyBitSet with  (64 < n < 0) will throw a runtime error
